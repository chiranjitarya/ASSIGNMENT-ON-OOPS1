        "Q.1 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. It's a way of designing and organizing code that simulates real-world objects and systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2 What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " * A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. It's a fundamental concept in OOP that allows you to create objects that share similar characteristics and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " * An object is an instance of a class, and it represents a real-world entity or concept. It has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe its characteristics and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " * Abstraction is the process of exposing only the essential features of an object or system while hiding its internal details. It's about showing what an object can do, without revealing how it does it. Abstraction helps to:\n",
        " - Reduce complexity\n",
        " - Improve modularity\n",
        " - Enhance flexibility\n",
        " Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and its associated methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class or object). It's about hiding the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world. Encapsulation helps to:\n",
        " - Protect data from external interference\n",
        " - Improve code organization\n",
        " - Enhance data security\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " * Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods in Python classes that are surrounded by double underscores (__) on either side of the method name. These methods are also known as \"magic methods\" or \"special methods.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        " * Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The inheriting class, known as the subclass or derived class, inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class, known as the superclass or base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7H What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " * Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used. This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling more flexibility and generic code.\n",
        "Q.8  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " * Encapsulation in Python is achieved through the use of classes and objects. Python provides a way to encapsulate data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " * A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10 What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " * Class Methods: Class methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than the instance of the class. They are used to define methods that belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class.\n",
        " Static Methods: Static methods are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class. They are used to define utility methods that don't depend on the state of the class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11 What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        " * Method overloading is a feature in some programming languages that allows multiple methods with the same name to be defined, but with different parameter lists. However, Python does not directly support method overloading like some other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12 What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " * Method overriding is a feature in OOP that allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass, but it can have a different implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.13  What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " * The property decorator in Python allows you to implement getters, setters, and deleters for attributes of a class. It provides a way to customize access to instance data, enabling you to add logic to attribute access and modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " * Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables more flexibility, generic code, and easier maintenance.\n",
        "Q.15 What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " * An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be inherited by other classes. Abstract classes provide a way to define a blueprint for other classes, specifying methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.16 What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a popular and effective programming paradigm. Some of the key benefits of OOP include:\n",
        "- Modularity: OOP allows you to break down a program into smaller, independent modules (objects) that can be developed and tested separately.\n",
        "- Reusability: OOP enables code reusability through inheritance and polymorphism, reducing the need to duplicate code.\n",
        "- Easier Maintenance: OOP makes it easier to modify and maintain code by providing a clear structure and organization.\n",
        "- Improved Code Readability: OOP promotes code readability by using meaningful object names, attributes, and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.17 What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " * Class Variables:\n",
        "- Shared by all instances: Class variables are shared by all instances of a class.\n",
        "- Defined at the class level: Class variables are defined at the class level, outside of any method.\n",
        "Instance Variables:\n",
        "- Unique to each instance: Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class.\n",
        "- Defined at the instance level: Instance variables are defined at the instance level, typically in the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.18 What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " * Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from more than one superclass or parent class. This enables a subclass to combine the attributes and methods of multiple superclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.19 Explain the purpose of \"__str__, 'and' __repr__, \" methods in Python?\n",
        " * The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python are special methods that are used to represent objects as strings.\n",
        "__str__ Method:\n",
        "- Purpose: The __str__ method is used to return a human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "- Use case: The __str__ method is typically used when you want to display an object in a user-friendly format, such as when printing an object.\n",
        "__repr__ Method:\n",
        "- Purpose: The __repr__ method is used to return a string representation of an object that is useful for debugging and logging.\n",
        "- Use case: The __repr__ method is typically used when you want to get a more detailed and informative representation of an object, such as when debugging or logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.20 What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        " * The super() function in Python is used to access the methods and properties of a parent or sibling class in a multiple inheritance scenario. It allows you to call methods of the superclass from a subclass, enabling more flexibility and modularity in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.21 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " * The __del__ method in Python is a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is also known as a finalizer or destructor.\n",
        "Q.22 What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " * @staticmethod:\n",
        "- No implicit parameter: A static method does not have an implicit first parameter (like self or cls).\n",
        "- No access to class or instance: A static method cannot access the class or instance variables.\n",
        " @classmethod:\n",
        "- Implicit cls parameter: A class method has an implicit first parameter (cls) that refers to the class.\n",
        "- Access to class: A class method can access the class variables and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.23 How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " * Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism works seamlessly with inheritance, enabling you to write more flexible and generic code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.24 What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " * Method chaining is a technique in object-oriented programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. Each method returns the object itself, allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.25 What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " * The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an object to be called as a function. It enables instances of a class to behave like functions, making them callable."
